The libredo code is written entirely in portable C, so I haven't
bothered with creating a ./configure script. The Makefile assumes a
Unix build environment; if you are building for some other target, you
may need to provide your own build instructions. Finally, please note
that the demonstration program, sokoban-example.c, does depend on the
ncurses library. If you don't have the ncurses development package
installed, you can just run "make test" to just build libredo.a and
run the unit tests.
