REDO LIBRARY

libredo is a simple library that makes it easy to add powerful undo
and redo commands to a logic puzzle game (or similar type of program).
Many such programs that provide undo and redo commands will remember
undone states only while a user is using these two commands. Once the
user uses some other command that changes state in a new way, all of
the undone states are forgotten. This limited functionality is common,
if not ubiquitous. I would like to see more programs offer something
better: that is what this library is provided for.


INSTALLATION

The libredo package provides the usual facility for building and
installing via:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The redo library is very simple. It consists of one C file and one
header file, and requires no unusual support from the compiler. Thus,
an alternative to installing the library is just to copy redo.[ch]
into your own project and use it directly.


DOCUMENTATION

The file libredo.html describes the library's API and how it is used.
(The same document is also made available as a man page, and a plain
text file.) In addition, the header file comments also provide brief
descriptions of each function call.

There is also an example program included (sokoban-example) which
provides a practical demonstration of the full API.
