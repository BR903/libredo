* version 0.9: 2021 Dec 21

The endpoint flag has been changed to allow callers to specify
multiple types of endpoints. The endpoint value, instead of a boolean,
can be any non-zero value between -128 and +127. Higher endpoint
values indicate preferred solutions.

The documentation build process has been updated. In addition, a
pre-built man page is included in the distribution, so that building
the docs is optional for most users.


* version 0.8: 2020 Mar 13

Function redo_updatesavedstate() has been added to the API to allow
non-comparing state data to be modified in-place.

The function redo_hassessionchanged() has been renamed to the less
misleaing redo_clearsessionchanged(). A new redo_hassessionchanged()
function has been added which doesn't modify the session.

Performance has been improved by adding a small internal hash table.

The documentation has undergone a major rewrite, and is also provided
as a man page.

A configure script has finally been added, and the makefile has been
rewritten accordingly.


* version 0.7: 2015 Nov 10

Modified redo_beginsession() to allow extra, non-comparing bytes to be
appended to the state data. This is the only API change.


* version 0.6: 2013 Apr 21

This is the first public release of libredo. (Prior to this, the code
for libredo existed only as part of a larger program.)
